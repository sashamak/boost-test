# boost-test

This is a a test assignment, where a pipenv virtual environment is created, input box coordinates are fetched and some stats are calculated based on them. I will assume python is installed on the machine where this is being run.

Start from navigating to the folder where the files are located and installing pipenv via command line:

pipenv install

Ensure the environment is set up:

pipenv shell

Pipfile requires Python 3.8 and if that is installed proceed with the following to test:

pipenv run python BoostAI.py http://dev.boostsport.ai/media/in_out.json
